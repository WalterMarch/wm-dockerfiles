# My dockerfiles

A repository to collect various dockerfiles I have created.

Some will be very basic since I wanted a basic image to play around in (for example, `perlbase` and `pybase` are mainly used for their REPLs).

The comments at the top of each of the files detail how I generally use the dockerfile. These are notes for myself and (obviously) you don't have to follow them.
